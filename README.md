# IFC2TSO

The IFC2TSO process includes algorithmic processing, complexity reduction and transfer of information from IFC models to TSO. The process has a modular design so that the individual process steps can also be used independently. A schematic representation of the process and the modular process steps IFC2GRAPH, GRAPH and GRAPH2TSO are shown below.

## Implementation
The Python 3.7.12 programming language was used to implement the IFC2TSO process. In addition to the basic functionality included, the standard libraries logging, argparse, json, os, uuid, math, datetime, shutil and zipfile were used to extend the functions. In addition, the libraries ifcopenshell 0.6.0 for parsing the IFC models, lxml 4.6.1 for the conception of the XML-based BCF files, NetworkX 2.5 for the handling of the graphs, Rtree 0.9.7 for the conception and query of the R-trees, NumPy 1.19.1 for the calculation of the absolute three-dimensional positions, trimesh 3.10.2 for the analysis of the spatial dependencies and rdflib 6.1.1 for the conception and serialization of the knowledge representation were used.

An Anaconda Environment of the programming environment is given under **env**. Anaconda can be downloaded and installed from the [Anaconda Homepage](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). A corresponding [manual](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) is also provided. The installation of the environment can be done with the help of the **environment.yml** file using the presented command.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Usage

The implementation of the IFC2TSO process is implemented as a command line interface application. Here, the user has to specify the paths of the IFC models as input. In addition, optional parameters can be used to customize the functionality of the process step. The call of the process is shown below and the optional parameters are explained in the table.

## Structure of the repository

Under **src** all scripts and necessary files for the functionality of the process are stored. **env** contains the anaconda environment for running the implementation. Under **modules** the source files of the modular process steps IFC2GRAPH, GRAPH and GRAPH2TSO and their corresponding environments are given to implement them independently.
